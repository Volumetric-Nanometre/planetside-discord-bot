## Who, what, when, where, why?

This is my first real stint into "proper" python techniques and code. You will 
probably see code which is poorly written or documented, however this is a work
in progress so hopefully any problems will be corrected. 

Why a discord bot? Well most of my work is typically high performance computing
code which is written in C. This means I lack prety much any knowledger on how 
to write in a pythonic fashion. I then tried writting various programs in
python, however as I has no "skin in the game" I got bored of it quite quickly.
Turns out tying the project to something I enjoy and wish to improve gave me 
the motivation needed to start a project stick with it. 

This is also a good time for me to learn how to use git properly, as I have
managed to get by using the github interface and hoping for the best.
